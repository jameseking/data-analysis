# data-analysis

I analyzed two data sets with over 13000 entries in each for this project. I looked at the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) data sets from 2007 and 2017. From the CDC's website:
"The YRBSS was developed in 1990 to monitor health behaviors that contribute markedly to the leading causes of death, disability, and social problems among youth and adults in the United States. These behaviors, often established during childhood and early adolescence, include:

-Behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence.
-Sexual behaviors related to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV infection.
-Alcohol and other drug use.
-Tobacco use.
-Unhealthy dietary behaviors.
-Inadequate physical activity.

In addition, the YRBSS monitors the prevalence of obesity and asthma and other health-related behaviors plus sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts."

I have extensive notes in my R code explaining the tests that I conducted and what my findings were.
